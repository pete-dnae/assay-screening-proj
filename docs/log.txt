    o  Start working through those that remain and new ones needed

    o  Get an experiment - providing rules script only as a link
    o  CRUD on rulesscript(s) including machine readable parse errors and
       results.
o  Get rid of redundant unit tests, fix up those that remain, and add any
   required.
o  Bring in allowed reagent names and grouping and units
o  New end point for selective results per type needed?
o  Line number of script that requested each cell's allocation needed?
