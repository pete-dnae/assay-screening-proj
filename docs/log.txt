Work log and Plan for <Bottomup> change of emphasis

*  Do a bit of analysis and design
*  See if can write code to infer premix opportunities
*  Go back to the model suggestions in bottom-up-model.txt to see if they 
   match properly this plan.
    *  Concentration needs fundamental change.
    *  Need new Reagent with name, lot, concentration
    *  Composition is a completely new class
    *  Measure
*  Write replacement reagents.py as above - keeping old version for reference.
*  Change Concentration to use only a floating point number as its single 
   source of truth. (But retain units for human presentation).
o  Adopt the new models and fix all existing code to use them.
    *  Scan through these trying first stab of code modes without running
        *  Models
        *  Views
        *  Serializers
        *  Urls
    o  Drive out integration work needed using
        o  Existing unit tests
        o  reset db
        o  Boot server
        o  Serve some pages from browser
o  In the reference experiment, ignore units temporarily and treat the ratio of
   the two numbers as being the absolute concentration value.
o  Change AllocRule to have no BLOCKS or CONSECUTIVE property - and instead
   just be a plain rectangular region specification. E.g. A-H, 1-5
o  Refer to chambers by column letter and row number in API
o  Focus just on the pre-amp plate for the time being...
o  Change the reference experiment to expand out primer kits, buffermix and
   mastermix and allocate these to wells explicitly with rules. (This makes
   the modelling of MasterMix and BufferMix redundant).
o  Remove all references to Mastermix and Buffermix in code and docs.
o  Work out how to make a well ingredient with its concentration hashable in
   preparation for the next step...
o  See if the Premix class works. I.e. is cabable of deducing the premix 
   opportunities for this new setup just in terms of the sets of what to mix.
o  Now add the volume / concentration calculations.
o  Explore how to expose the bottom-up inference of premixes through the API.
