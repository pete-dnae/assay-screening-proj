Work log and Plan for <Bottomup> change of emphasis

*  Do a bit of analysis and design
*  See if can write code to infer premix opportunities
*  Go back to the model suggestions in bottom-up-model.txt to see if they 
   match properly this plan.
    *  Concentration needs fundamental change.
    *  Need new Reagent with name, lot, concentration
    *  Composition is a completely new class
    *  Measure
*  Write replacement reagents.py as above - keeping old version for reference.
*  Change Concentration to use only a floating point number as its single 
   source of truth. (But retain units for human presentation).
*  Adopt the new models and fix all existing code to use them.
    *  Scan through these trying first stab of code modes without running
        *  Models
        *  Views
        *  Serializers
        *  Urls
    *  Drive out integration work needed using
        *  Existing unit tests
            *  app.tests.test_system.py
            *  test_experiment_copy
        *  reset db
        *  Boot server
        *  Serve some pages from browser
*  In the reference experiment, ignore units temporarily and treat the ratio of
   the two numbers as being the absolute concentration value.
*  Change AllocRule to have no BLOCKS or CONSECUTIVE property - and instead
   just be a plain rectangular region specification. E.g. "A-H 1-5"
*  Refer to chambers by column letter and row number in API
o  Pete code review Prasanna's changes
    o  rule and rule interpreter
    o  make reference experiment
    o  plate models
o  Do unit tests still work?
o  Does reset_db still work?
o  Does api still serve?
o  Focus just on the pre-amp plate for the time being...
o  Change the reference experiment to expand out primer kits, buffermix and
   mastermix and allocate these to wells explicitly with rules. (This makes
   the modelling of MasterMix and BufferMix redundant).
o  Remove all references to Mastermix and Buffermix in code and docs.
o  Work out how to make a well ingredient with its concentration hashable in
   preparation for the next step...
o  See if the Premix class works. I.e. is cabable of deducing the premix 
   opportunities for this new setup just in terms of the sets of what to mix.
o  Now add the volume / concentration calculations.
o  Explore how to expose the bottom-up inference of premixes through the API.
o  Change the contract for AllocRule - to drop the idea that later rules
   override earlier ones. Also provide info in the API about which cells have
   been covered by a rule set, and which have not. Treat two rules allocating
   something to the same cell as an error.
