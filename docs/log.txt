*  Deal with reagent categories
o  The A...A index bug
    o  Suggest to Prasanna that we only report the line that is wrong, and
       that I can still provide an index - but it can be the first character in
       the offending line.
o  Think clone is obsolete
o  Bring in pools in every respect
o  Front end backlog
o  Provide endpoint that Chris' script needs
o  Get rid of all out of data documentation
o  Plan and prepare for deployment
    o  Non debug django mode
    o  No import of pdb
o  Deploy
