Work log and Plan for <Bottomup> change of emphasis

o  Digression - can we define the rules with a text script?
    *  Design a script language
    *  Have this reviewed by Chris / iterate / improve it until ok, and it is
       capable of coping with the more general cases too
    *  See if we can express our reference experiment using this language
       (a paper exercise)
    *  Does it look ok / amenable?
    *  What conceptual problems does this throw up / fix them
    *  Formalise the specification for the language
o  How to change the back end code that deals with rules to take this as input?
    *  Make a design outline hypothesis (see bottom of this document)
    *  Try to code all the model changes suggested at the bottom
    *  Create and unit-test the BE rules script parser
    o  Update and unit test the ExperimentPremixer and AllocationResults
        *  Create new classes as per review 26th Feb
        o  Do it
        o  Evolve a unit test that:
            o  creates a simple experiment with a simple rules script
            o  interprets the rules script to make alloc instructions
            o  uses the experiment premixer to discover premixes
            o  does a few smoke-test checks on the resultant premixes
        o  Now fix everything to do with concentrations
            o  Upgrade conc class
            o  Unit test teh converters in isolation
    o  Design (with Pete) how conc calcs will work in congjunction with the
       premix tree, and with the plate well volume.
    o  Add in this code and logic alongside or as part of the experiment
       premixer.
        o  Test this with unit tests, including repairing or augmenting the 
           old ones above to check for correct volume/conc calcs.,

    o  Fix up the big create reference experiment to work the new way
    o  Take a breath
    o  Now think about front end and serialization

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class Design Thinking
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

o  The big picture
    o  We have a new class RulesScript
        o  Is-a Django model that has just a single field - the script's text.
        o  This becomes the single source of truth for rules in an experiment,
           which we serialize.
        o  The experiment model has-a RulesScript instead of its plates field.
    o  We have a new class RulesScriptInterpreter
        o  Produces a Python list of AllocRule in response to being given
           the rules script as one big string.
        o  Much emphasis on error handling
        o  Much emphasis on very careful and simple struture
        o  Much emphasis on making it easy to replicate in Javascript
    o  We retain many of the previous rules modelling classes and their
       collaborators, but we never store these in the database. We keep these
       to become our way of getting a handle on machine-readable representations
       of rules that we can pass around. These they will be used only
       transiently in memory, and should cease to be Django models, and moved
       into a separate package.

o  SourceRowCol
    o  plate number
    o  row
    o  column

o  PlacementInstructions
    o  A new class to contain the rows/columns/conc part of our old friend
       AllocRule

o  AllocRule
    o  Has a Reagent reference
    o  Has-A PlacementInstructions
    o  The rank for ordering becomes redundant.
    o  It no longer has a payload type
    o  Replace the Reagent FK with a plain python attribute that points to a
       Reagent object.


o  TransferRule
    o  Has-A SourceRowCol
    o  Has-A PlacementInstructions

o  Reagent
    o  No longer is-a Django model, and don't need in database.

o  RuleList
    o  We can ditch this class.
    o  It collapses down to a Python list of AllocRule when we need one.

o  AllocationInstructions
    o  We can ditch this class.
    o  Ok, so we loose supressed_columns, but lets forget about them for now.

o  Plate
    o  We can ditch this class.

o  AllocationResults
    o  Remains a nested dictionary keyed on row/columm.
    o  But with a different leaf-value type. (this is done already)
    o  No longer a dictionary keyed on strings like 'Strain'
    o  But instead a list of Reagent objects.

o  AllocRuleInterpreter
    o  Hopefully stays the same, bar the odd tweak?

o  ExperimentPremixer
    o  Think stays the same
