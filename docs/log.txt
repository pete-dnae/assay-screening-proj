*  Return to groups...
    *  Change defn of group to: name, reagent, conc, units

        *  Design content from Prasanna's email.

        *  Add system level test
    o  How to document that it exists?
        *  Read about schema again from drf docs
        o  Commit / Push noting commit before experimenting
o  Do rest of fantasy views

o  Syntax spelling errors in web gui inappropriate
o  Starter scripts to prepopulate / augment db with reagents and groups
