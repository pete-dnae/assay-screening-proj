Work log and Plan for <Bottomup> change of emphasis

*  Fix up unit tests / reset_db / serving API
o  See if the Premix class works. I.e. is cabable of deducing the premix 
   opportunities for this new setup just in terms of the sets of what to mix.
o  Now add the volume / concentration calculations.
o  Explore how to expose the bottom-up inference of premixes through the API.
o  Change the contract for AllocRule - to drop the idea that later rules
   override earlier ones. Also provide info in the API about which cells have
   been covered by a rule set, and which have not. Treat two rules allocating
   something to the same cell as an error.
o  Bring all docs up to date
o  Seperate finders from making reference experiment
