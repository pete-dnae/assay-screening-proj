*  Update parser to deal with new rules script spec
*  Make the parser emit machine readable error messages
*  Update rules interpreter to match
*  Pare down the database and models to only the minimum needed and 
   anticipated
    *  Work out carefully what is needed and new wanted and list
    *  Ditch those to drop as rough pass

    *  empty_app_tables
    *  pop_with_ref

    *  reset db simple
o  Replace make reference experiment with new one using script
    *  Code make ref exp as wanted
    o  Now ditch no longer modules in this directory
o  Cut down views, serializer, end points to minimum required and make them
    o  List all experiments whose name includes XXX
    o  Get an experiment - leaving rules script only as link
    o  Get the allowed names for reagents grouped into their types
    o  Get the allowed units strings
    o  Accept a modified rules script and feedback parsed info and alloc
    o  Post a new reagent name with its type
    o  Get the allocation results for an experiment - for a specified reagent
       type or is this part of general get alloc payload?
o  Get rid of redundant unit tests, fix up those that remain, and add any
   required.
o  Bring in reagent groups
o  Bring in pools in every respect
o  Provide endpoint that Chris' script needs
o  Get rid of all out of data documentation
o  Plan and prepare for deployment
o  Deploy
