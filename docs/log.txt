o  Front end backlog

o  Bug (I think back-end - if you type just "A TC" into a line it says
   "Field number 3 (Columns specification is missing. Line <x>


o  Return to groups...
    *  Add error checking if reagent added to reagent group is of incompatible
       reagent_type
        *  Implement validate method
        *  Need object level
        *  But does this call the base validation also? = yes
        *  Add to make reference experiment
    o  Mistake - groups must have conc and units too for each reagent

o  Add tolerance of groups in script in place of reagents
    o  Design
    o  Do
    o  Unit test
    o  Add to reference experiment
    o  Show tolerance of rule citing a group in script
o  Front end backlog
    o  Search needed?
o  Starter scripts to prepopulate / augment db
o  Provide endpoint that Chris' script needs
o  Get rid of all out of data documentation
o  Plan and prepare for deployment
    o  Move head to bottom up
    o  Non debug django mode
    o  No import of pdb
    o  Security?
o  Deploy

Groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A table of <ReagentGroup>s
Each of which has-a name.
Each of which has-a ReagentCategory FK.
Each of which has-a m2m field of Reagent FK.

Must make it a bad request if receive a write op that includes a Reagent FK
that references a Reagent of a mis-matched category.
