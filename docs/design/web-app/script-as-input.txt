Consider a Domain-Specific-Language to Specify Rules:

First of all let us consider a single plate...

      Titanium-Taq            1-12  A-H 0.02 x
      (Eco)-ATCC-BAA-2355     1,5,9 A-H 2.00E+04 copies/ul
      HgDna                   1-8   G-H 50 ng/foo
      Ec_uidA_6.x_Eco63_Eco60 5-8   A-H 0.4 uM/bar

The implied column headings are:

    - Unique name
    - Columns
    - Rows
    - Concentration value
    - Concentration units

You just start typing all the lines above into a *smart* text editor pane 
in the GUI. Plus you can copy/paste just like any other editor.

What does *smart* mean?

    o  It knows what a properly-formed line looks like
    o  Guides you as you type, on a keystroke-by-keystroke basis...
    o  Auto-completion on the name field
    o  Validates the columns as being one of these formats:
            3
            1-4
            3,4,5
    o  Validates the rows as being one of these formats:
            A
            A-D
            A,B,C
    o  Validates the concentration value as being a number
    o  Auto-completes and validates the concentration units string
    o  You can just enter one space between fields as you type...
    o  ... and it auto-aligns the fields for you dynamically
    o  It will use a mono-spaced font (like Courier) so that characters line up
       vertically.

Now let us consider multiple plates...

Here we show the same rules fragment as above but in the context of rules for 
multiple plates...


    PLATE 1:1

      Titanium-Taq            1-12  A-H 0.02 x
      (Eco)-ATCC-BAA-2355     1,5,9 A-H 2.00E+04 copies/ul
      HgDna                   1-8   G-H 50 ng/foo
      Ec_uidA_6.x_Eco63_Eco60 5-8   A-H 0.4 uM/bar

    PLATE 1:2

      Transfer                1,5,9 A-H 0.02 dilution
      Ec_uidA_x.2_Eco64_Eco66 1,5,9 A-H 2.00E+04 copies/ul

    PLATE 2:1

      Titanium-Taq            1-12  A-H 0.02 x
      etc...

We number each plate in the experiment with a two-part number.

    <logical plate>:<physical plate>

    In the example, the use of 1:1 and 1:2 tells the system that some of the 
    fluid from 1:1 will be used (after it has undergone its process) 
    to initialise 1:2. (It's not limited to two).

    Note how the first rule for PLATE 1:2 uses the reserved name *Transfer*.
    Note also how the concentration units for this one introduces a new
    permitted units string *dilution*.


Wider GUI Support

    o  You see some kind of visual / graphical feedback of the grid layout
       you are creating as you go. (For all plates?)
    o  You have other tabs / links that let you curate what the legal unique
       names are.

Concentration Debate

    We (in software) want to say that concentrations inside the system and
    under the hood, are always defined as dimensionless, volumetric ratios
    w.r.t. water. Have no notions of final or stock. And are defined regardless
    of actual volume.  This includes HgDNA, strain counts etc. But of course we
    can make it so that this not what humans ever see by letting the user
    specify preferred units and entering / reading values only in these terms.
    But it does mean that all of the choices we offer for preferred units MUST
    BE mathematically equivalent to pure volumetric ratios w.r.t. water.

    Is this possible / workable for the scientists?
