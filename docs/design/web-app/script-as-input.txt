Consider a Domain-Specific-Language to Specify Rules:

First of all let us consider a single plate...

      A Titanium-Taq            1-12  A-H 0.02 x
      A (Eco)-ATCC-BAA-2355     1,5,9 A-H 2.00E+04 copies/ul
      A HgDna                   1-8   G-H 50 ng/foo
      A Ec_uidA_6.x_Eco63_Eco60 5-8   A-H 0.4 uM/bar

The implied column headings are:

    - Rule type (A:Allocate, or T:Transfer) # We'll come back to transfer.
    - Unique name
    - Columns
    - Rows
    - Concentration value
    - Concentration units

You just start typing all the lines above into a *smart* text editor pane 
in the GUI. Plus you can copy/paste just like any other editor.

What does *smart* mean?

    o  It knows what a properly-formed line looks like
    o  Guides you as you type, on a keystroke-by-keystroke basis...
    o  Auto-completion suggestions on name field
        - E.g. type Eco and see everthing that has 'Eco' in it.
    o  Validates the columns as being one of these formats:
            3
            1-4
            3,4,5
    o  Validates the rows as being one of these formats:
            A
            A-D
            A,B,C
    o  Validates the concentration value as being a number
    o  Auto-completes and validates the concentration units string
    o  You can just enter one space between fields as you type...
    o  ... and it auto-aligns the fields for you dynamically
    o  It will use a mono-spaced font (like Courier) so that characters line up
       vertically.
    o  It "knows" which field you've got to on a line
    o  It offers advice based on this at the bottom somewhere
    o  It makes the text you've put in different colours to indicate when it's
       understood that field, or not yet.

Now let us consider multiple plates...

Here we show the same rules fragment as above but in the context of rules for 
multiple plates. The script specifies the allocation for all of the plates.

A Titanium-Taq 1-12 A-H 0.02 x
    P1

      A Titanium-Taq            1-12  A-H 0.02 x
      A (Eco)-ATCC-BAA-2355     1,5,9 A-H 2.00E+04 copies/ul
      A HgDna                   1-8   G-H 50 ng/foo
      A Ec_uidA_6.x_Eco63_Eco60 5-8   A-H 0.4 uM/bar

    P2

      T P1                      1,5,9 A-H 0.02 dilution
      A Ec_uidA_x.2_Eco64_Eco66 1,5,9 A-H 2.00E+04 copies/ul

    P3

      A Titanium-Taq            1-12  A-H 0.02 x
      etc...

We number each plate in the experiment as P1, P2, P3, ... etc.

    Note how the rules for plate 2 introduces the other rule type 'T' - 
    meaning transfer. Instead of a reagent name you specify the plate
    the liquid should be taken from. This assumes the source chambers are the
    same row/column as the destination row/column. 

    Note also the units used on this concentration *dilution*



Wider GUI Support

    o  You see some kind of visual / graphical feedback of the grid layout
       you are creating as you go. (For all plates?)
    o  You'll have a way of choosing a reagent, and then checking and 
       visualising where you've put it.
    o  You have other tabs / links that let you curate what the legal unique
       names are.

Concentration Debate

    We (in software) want to say that concentrations inside the system and
    under the hood, are always defined as dimensionless, molecule-count ratios
    w.r.t. water. Have no notions of final or stock. And are defined regardless
    of actual volume.  This includes HgDNA, strain counts etc. But of course we
    can make it so that this not what humans ever see by letting the user
    specify preferred units and entering / reading values only in these terms.
    But it does mean that all of the choices we offer for preferred units MUST
    BE mathematically equivalent to pure molecule-count ratios w.r.t. water.

    Is this possible / workable for the scientists?
