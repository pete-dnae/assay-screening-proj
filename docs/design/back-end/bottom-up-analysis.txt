A concentrated premix can be be made for a set of wells IFF

    - All the wells need all of the things in the premix.
    - At the same concentrations as each other.

So how do we detect the opportunity for a premix?

    - That a set of reagents exists:
        - that is used by more than one chamber at exactly the same 
          concentrations

What is a measure of merit in choosing a set to be a premix?

    - The number of chambers that it is for.

Towards an algorithm

    - Init wells to final mix/concentrations.
    - Deplete wells accordingly when premixes made for them.
    - Iteratively...
    - seed = the most shared reagent-conc and its target chambers.
    - Build a premix comprising the set of reagent-concs comprising this seed, 
      reagent-conc, plus any other reagent-concs that are present in all of 
      the target chambers.

Will this discover a single buffermix, plus two mastermixes?
E.g.

    Buffer = AB
    Master1 = ABC
    Master2 = ABD

    1   ABC E
    2   ABC F
    3   ABD G
    4   ABD H
    Seed=A, target=1234
    Expanded=AB = (Buffer)

    1   C E
    2   C F
    3   D G
    4   D H
    Seed=C, target=12
    Expanded=C = (Mastermix1 when combined with buffer)

    1     E
    2     F
    3   D G
    4   D H
    Seed=D, target=34
    Expanded=D = (Mastermix2 when combined with buffer)
