# Some Definition Debate

We will make life very much easier for ourselves if we can get our working set 
of core type-definitions as near perfect as is practical.

## Reagent 

We use the abstraction of Reagent to mean a carefully prescribed liquid
composition. This can include mixtures, defined recursively, and it can include
the specification of consuming diluted variants of other reagents.

But reagents are not abstract, we procure, make, store and deploy *volumes* of
them. We might store some semi-permanently as stock items. These volumes are
associated with a supplier, and have for example a lot number.  In this case we
should be able to recognize two different lots of a reagent having identical
compositions to each other, as being distinct.

Other times we create a short-lived volume of a reagent by putting some in 
a chamber on a plate.

Sometimes the reagent volume in a chamber on a plate undergoes a process. (Like
being put into a pre-amp PCR machine). We could regard this process as
defining a a new reagent. I.e. a process output reagent. Or we could leave this
as being obvious to a human and entirely implicit?

When we define reagents as being mixtures that comprise diluted variants of
other reagents, we are obliged to address the source reagents. Should this be a
reference to a volume or a reagent type?

Should we say that there is no such thing as an abstract reagent type, and deal
only with physical reagent volumes?


- Concentration confuse me...

    - Does a concentration define a state or a transformation?
    - I.e. is the name concentration correct, or is it more properly a 
      relative dilution specificiation.
    - Could it hypothetically be defined as a floating point ratio, or do the
      customary two numbers mean something more?
    - What about it is absolute vs relative?
    - Does it's definion have any knowledge of what it refers to?
    - What is its relationship with volume - in particular when units are
      heterogeneous?
    - Considering the debate about reagents above, does a concentration refer
      to a reagent type, or a reagent volume?
    - Should a dilution step - define a new reagent per se?
    - What is the difference / plurality of adding water to a reagent to dilute
      it, vs taking a small volumetric proportion of an existing reagent
      volume?
