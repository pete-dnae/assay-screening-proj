Liquid
    - The word Liquid is not part of our formal modelling.
    - But we all know what a liquid is.
    - We use the term below when we want deliberately, to avoid using a 
      formally defined term.
    
Reagent
    - The chemical definition of a type of liquid that we can go out and buy,
      and that we will view as a primitive, non-divisible, building block.
    - Is a type for a thing, but is not a thing. Is not tangible.
    - A Reagent cannot have a volume or a mass because it is a type for a 
      thing, not the presence or instance of a thing.
    - It's an adjective not a noun..
    - You can buy a thing that is purple, but you cannot buy "a purple".
    - E.g. a primer type, strain type, DNA-free water.
    - The definition, very deliberately, does not know about the concept of 
      concentrations.
    - We can procure a *volume* of liquid that is of this type, and the 
      *volume* we procure then *does* have a known *Concentration*.
    - Another day we might procure some of this stuff with a different
      concentration. We would then be procuring a distinct *Volume* of the
      same *Reagent*.

Concentration
    - The definition of how much of a *Reagent* is present in a liquid, 
      that also comprises water.
    - The liquid may contain other things too.
    - Specifies the amount of the *Reagent* present as a proportion of the
      amount of water present in that liquid.
    - Specified using a single number, and the units. There is a family of
      units available to make the number cited more convenient to humans.
    - E.g. mg/micro-litre et al.
    - These units are not fundamental to the definition, but change the
      interpretation of the number used.
    - Ultimately it is nothing more or less than a volumetric ratio.
    - Note we exclude the customery notions of "stock" and "final".
    - We emphasise that a Concentration is a self-contained state, that has no
      recognition of some prior state or source.
    - When you have read the rest of this modelling stuff, you will see that
      Concentrations are available at every place we want them to be - but not
      explicitly. They are an implicit derivable property.
    - This is not say that we expose the model to humans via a UXP that way. On
      the contrary perhaps. But our models are here to capture the smallest
      possible, truest version of the truth we can find.

Volume
    - A particular, tangible, physical lump/blob/slug, of a liquid of known 
      *Composition*, that lives in a container dedicated to it.
    - The Volume Has-A *Composition*.
    - The container is "addressable".
    - It might be a bottle in a fridge, addressable by the label on it that
      includes includes the supplier's stock-code.
    - It might be a beaker or tube made up as an intermediate step in 
      building an experiment, addressable (tdb).
    - It might be a a well on a plate, addressable by its plate/row/column.
    - References to the container address and the *Volume* mean the same thing;
      they are interchangeable.
    - A volume/container's *composition* **never** changes.
    - A volume/container has a fixed (volumetric) initial volume.
    - But a volume may be depleted by removing some of its contents to be
      deployed elsewhere. (This does not change the original volume's 
      *Composition*)
    - I.e. a volume always has an initial volume property and can have a 
      depleted volume state.

    DROP STATE OF Depletion


Composition
    - Defines a specification for how liquids may be combined.
    - I.e. a mixture specification.
    - The specification defines the liquids of which it is made up, by making
      references to *Volumes*. I.e. the *Volume*s that provide the source
      liquids. I.e. where each liquid that make up this composition is to be
      drawn from. Think pipetting, and see Note 1.
    - When the referenced volume is a well on a plate, we take this to mean,
      by-definition, the liquid in that well **after** it has undergone 
      any process transformation intended for it. For example if the referenced
      volume is a chamber on a plate intended to go through a pre-amp process,
      the reference means the post-amplication liquid.
    - A composition defines how much of the referenced source volume should go
      into this composition as an absolute volumetric volume.
    - E.g. Take 10mL of the original volume.

    - A Composition, does not, in of itself, have a volume. (It is used as part
      of the definition of a *Volume*)
    - Note the constituents are defined by references to *Volume*s not 
      *Reagents*. 
    - And observe that a *Volume* has a *Composition*.
    - And hence the definition of a Composition is intrinsically recursive.


Note 1
    Observe that this set of models exists to manifest a step by step human 
    process and work instruction, as well as to simply define truths. So 
    where part of the model must be "acted out" by a human, let us keep 
    our models in those terms as far as is practical.

Debate Not Having Concentrations as a First Class Citizen

    I'm suggesting we define the models in terms of how liquids are deployed
    and mixed at a practical level. But we know the experiment designer needs
    to be able to think and design in terms of concentrations.

    Nothing is lost to support this with these models.
    We can make it so that the UXP for the experiment designer lets them
    specify the concentrations they want, where it suits them. Our code under
    the hood can flip between concentrations and pipetting volume transfers any
    time it likes. They are mathematically equivalent.

    It is tempting to challenge the way mixtures are defined to use
    concentrations. But how can we? With nested sources, where volumes begat
    volumes, each containing mixtures, how can the contribution of one into
    antoher be defined in terms of concentrations? Concentrations of what?

Consider defining final wells with constituents at concentrations, system should be able to build
the tree of opportunity for combining things in advance.
