# Notes from various chats with Chris

PrimerPairs are not strictly pairs. They can have a set of forward primers and
a set of reverse items. (What does that really mean?)

One plate on example spreadsheet represents two physical plates one that will
undergo preamp, while the other undergoes ID. In this case the reagents for
both processes are superimposed in the cell info. It is only the human that
knows that some of the reagents should be placed onto the first plate, and that
some of the reagents for the second plate are to be taken from the first plate
after it has gone through its process; usually diluted again in so doing.
