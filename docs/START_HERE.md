Background and developer getting started ../developer-briefing.md

The REST API code lives in ../app

The web front end code lives in ../webapp

An example python script to query the public deployed API lives in 
../clients/example-script.py

You can store client code that depends on the API in ../clients/your-dir
(which makes it possible to maintain them easier in lock-step with the API).
