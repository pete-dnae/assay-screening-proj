FOR MVP
-------


o  Put title in banner strip.
o  Format transfers so that destinatino row/col lines up with that of
   allcoation rule.
o  Let user re-size either side to avoid wrapping
o  Implement save-as feature.


o  Make sure that the files deployed to form the front end are immutable.
   Any variation between deployments must come from environment variables 
   rather than code. Its ok to have alternate config files. But you ship them
   both, and have the *runtime* consult an *environment* variable to 
   choose which to use. See 12-factors #Config and #Dev/Prod parity.

o  Make sure we have a deployable front end by testing it properly deployed.


LATER
-----

o  Example script popup should be monospaced font and auto formatted.

o  At boot time the app should load the most recently viewed 
   experiment when there is one, otherwise the reference experiment from 
   the db.
