New Observations for Prasanna to Categorize
    *  'Hover over well' label doesn't show up until you hover over a well
       for the first time.
    x  Example script popup should be monospaced font and auto formatted.
        Prasanna : Aware of this happening . unable to enforce it, need some time and attention
    X  Seem to have spell check active on script editor?
        Prasanna : No its chrome performing the spell check thing.

ToolTip Use Cases:
    *  Experiment name search have tool tip.
    *  Copy link has tool tip.
    *  Tooltips on Experiments|Reagents|Plates
    *  Info icon needs tooltip.
    *  The format icon needs a tooltip.
    x  Hover over a line needs a tooltip.
        Prasanna: Need some time to read on this , needs to be customized in quill editor

Pop Up Use Cases :
    o  Contents of B3 list - would prefer reagents to be either left or right
       justified instead of centred.


Cosmetic Changes/Additions:
    o  Put in an image and title in banner strip.
    o   Experiment name field How about tacking on a box extension to the right
        with the search icon in it - like gmail's? Maybe using
        https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components/input-group
    *  "Cannot show plate visualisation while there are errors in your
        rules script".
    o  Consider using Bootstrap Wells (or similar) to delineate and group the 
       major areas of the screen.
    o  On my browser config and default zoom, the text editor is not wide enough
       and the transfer rule wraps.
    o  On may browser config and default zoom, the "contents of" area 
       disappears off the bottom. Need to brainstorm best answer to this.


Vue Changes:
    o  Don't think changing to a new experiment (if you create one in the
       browsable API), is saving changes to new rules script end-point?
    o  Implement save-as feature.
    o  Visualizations per plate ?

Vuex change:
    o  At boot time the app should load the most recently viewed 
       experiment when there is one, otherwise the reference experiment from 
       the db.

DOM and JS Changes:
    o  The hovering over a line <HOL> **target zone** doesn't seem quite right.
       Particularly as you travel up the page?

Vanilla JS Changes(external js files):

Existing Features:
    o  Make sure that the files deployed to form the front end are immutable.
       Any variation between deployments must come from environment variables 
       rather than code. Its ok to have alternate config files. But you ship them
       both, and have the *runtime* consult an *environment* variable to 
       choose which to use. See 12-factors #Config and #Dev/Prod parity.

Deployment Checks:
    o  Make sure we have a deployable front end by testing it properly deployed.
