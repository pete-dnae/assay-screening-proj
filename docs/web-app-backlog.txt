ToolTip Use Cases:
    o  Experiment name search have tool tip.
    o  Copy link has tool tip.
    o  Tooltips on Experiments|Reagents|Plates
    o  Info icon needs tooltip.
    o  The format icon needs a tooltip.
    o  Hover over a line needs a tooltip.

Pop Up Use Cases :
    o  Plates and Pools pop up "this feature coming soon".

Removing Cosmetics:
    #  Experiment name field need not be preceded by the "Experiment" label.
            Pete: I prefer it without the label, but I now think it is too
            naked. How about tacking on a box extension to the right with the
            search icon in it - like gmail's? Maybe using
            https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs/components/input-group

Cosmetic Changes/Additions:
    o  Put in an image and title in banner strip.
    x  Change Experiment|Reagents|Plates to Reagents|Plates|Pools
        # Need Home button on other pages then . 
            # Pete: sorry I meant Experiment|Reagents|Pools
        ie How to get back to experiment page from other pages 
    x  Change the format icon to the right-justify icon because the current one
   implies not formatting but a menu.
        # Current one is "fa-align-justify" icon ,
         would right align look confusing as we aren't performing right align?
            # Pete: We kinda are performing right align, but on a whole column
            # basis - I'm happy with it.
    x  The plate viz needs the rows / cols decorated with numbers /
   letters.
        # Although this is acheived , Not quite comfortable with the logic used
         we are trying to achieve a graph with a html table
            # Pete - it's also made the cells rather big too. Would it work to 
            # go
            # back to what you had before, but have an extra top row and an
            # extra left column built in the table, with hard-coded
            # letters/numbers?
            # The new implementation also creates a dead-spot for well hovering
            # in the margin of each well.
   x  ERIS - display in plate viz as well as sad face - "Cannot show plate
   visualisation while there are errors in your rules script".
   #Cannot display plate viz while error as the error response nullifies table data 
   and lnum data without which table visualizations aren't a possiblity.
   Can't Ignore the error response getting added to the state as well (feels weird).    
        # Pete - I see I haven't communicated my suggestion right. I meant to keep the
        # behaviour the same, of not showing the table viz when there was an error. But instead
        # of just showing the sad face, to show the explanatory message as well.
   x  Consider using Bootstrap Wells to delineate and group the major areas of the
   screen.
   #bootstrap wells are depreciated ,but I got your point
   o  On may browser config and default zoom, the text editor is not wide enough
   and the transfer rule wraps.
   o  On may browser config and default zoom, the "contents of" area disappears
   off the bottom. Need to brainstorm best answer to this.


Vue Changes :
    x  Load reference experiment from db at boot time.
        #The app by default loads exp No 1
        # Pete - that's fine.
    o  Info icon should bring up example script.
    o  The example experiment shown on help, should be the reference experiment
   from the database, so that as we evolve the language, and update the
   reference experiment, so the help example changes with it.

Vuex change:
    o  At boot time the app should load the most recently viewed experiment when
   there is one, otherwise the reference experiment from the db.

DOM and JS Changes:
    o  The hovering over a line <HOL> target zone doesn't seem quite right.
    Particularly as you travel up the page?
    x  Rule Hover highlight and table viz corresponding should evaporate if you're not
       still hovering.
       # when do we decide that the user isnt hovering ?. 
         case : user isnt hovering if she moves the mouse out of editor window
         result: user wont be able to hover over a well as the viz would have disappeared
                once she is out of editor window
         case : user isnt hovering if she starts typing again
         result: user wont be able to see viz as she types 
       # Pete - my communication error again here. I meant, for the table grid to
         stick around after the hover leaves an <A> or <T> rule, but for the 
         targeted-wells highlight to not get left on screen.

Vanilla JS Changes(external js files):
    #  Auto format should leave comment lines alone
        # Pete - I think this has caused a side-effect bug...
        # The newline between the comment and the next line got lost, so
        # that Plate42 becomes part of the comment.
    o  Auto complete while suggestions are up, seems to freeze saving sometimes.
    o  Auto complete how is position of pop up resilient?
    o  Auto complete, once you select something, the pop up stays up, and it
       doesn't trigger a save?
    o  Auto save - I reckon we could set the time a tiny bit quicker?

Existing Features:
    o  Make sure the config of the front end to let it switch between dev mode
       and deployed mode - follows 12-factor principles. Probably means using
       environmen tvariables.
    x  Update developer docs for front end.
        #need more clarity on this ,existing docs will enable anyone to deploy the app
            # Pete - ok if no changes needed - that's fine.

Deployment Checks:
    o  Make sure we have a deployable front end by testing it properly deployed.


BUGS:
    o  Bug (I think back-end - if you type just "A TC" into a line it says
   "Field number 3 (Columns specification is missing. Line <x>

NEW OBSERVATIONS
    o  Don't think changing to a new experiment (if you create one in the 
       browsable API), is saving changes to new rules script end-point?
    o  Implement save-as feature.
